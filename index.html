Badminton is a sport that makes me feel active and healthy while having fun. It is the source of my energy. Playing this sport makes me feel strong and confident. Each stroke of the racket makes the typical “whoosh” sound that I love. I feel I could rule the world with my precise and calculated strokes.


 
Badminton is a sport of beauty. It is crafted with elegance and precision- the best combination. The roots of this great sport date back to the 19th century British ruled India. It originated from a game called George Cajoles that started in Pune. The British officials started it, and when they went back to England, the game grew in popularity quickly. The Bath Badminton Club first arranged the rules of badminton in 1877. The first Open Badminton Championship is the first tournament of this great game, in 1899. Badminton is an official sport in the Olympics since 1992. Though it originated in England, it is now widely played in Asian countries such as India, South Korea, Indonesia, China, etc. The Asian Championship also has a place for this sport.

The game is simple. Either 2 or 4 people play each time, and you require two rackets and a shuttlecock. The players have to serve the shuttlecock, and the other side has to hit it back and not let it touch the floor. If the shuttlecock hits the floor, the other side receives a point. They also get to serve. The match is divided into sets of two. The first team or player to reach 21 points becomes the winner.  I love to play badminton with my family and friends. I use it as a means of spending time with my family. When I feel particularly competitive, I keep the score, and when I feel upset, I play to release some of the stress. In all moods, I like to play badminton.
